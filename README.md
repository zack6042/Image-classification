# Image Classification Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of deep learning techniques for multiple object classification utilizing two of the most powerful pretrained models available: VGG16 and RESNET50. These models are well-known in the field of computer vision for their effectiveness and efficiency in handling complex image classification tasks.

## Features
- **Object Classification:** Classifies multiple objects within an image.
- **Pretrained Models:** Leverages the capabilities of VGG16 and RESNET50.
- **Deep Learning Techniques:** Implements advanced deep learning methodologies to enhance classification accuracy.

## Access the Notebook
The implementation is available through a Google Colab notebook. You can access the notebook via the following link:
- [Image Classification with VGG16 and RESNET50 Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NBd6gU8Lr5ciAgiwpcoyIdLqiYLqLfid?usp=sharing)

## Technologies Used
- **TensorFlow:** An open-source software library for machine learning.
- **Keras:** A high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow.
- **Python:** The programming language used to create the machine learning model and handle data preprocessing.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. Open the notebook link provided above in Google Colab.
2. Click on `File` > `Save a copy in Drive` to add the notebook to your Google Drive.
3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the code cells and observe the classification results.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have:
- A Google account to access Google Colab.
- Basic familiarity with Python and neural networks.

## Usage
The notebook is self-contained with all necessary code and explanations provided. Hereâ€™s how to use it:
1. Run each cell sequentially to load the data, preprocess it, and set up the pretrained models.
2. Adjust parameters or modify sections of the notebook to experiment with different aspects of the machine learning models.
3. Analyze the output and experiment with different images to test the robustness of the models.
